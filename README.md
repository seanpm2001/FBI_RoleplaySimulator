## About

This is a very basic game in Python that I made in either 2018, 2019, or 2020. It is a joke program and doesn't have much purpose. It is a joke based on the pun .pedo (file) as in pedophile.

It contains ASCII Hentai, although not explicit. Unfortunately, the sauce may never be found.

It is incredibly inefficient, and definitely can be written better. It is also incredibly sophomoric, and has MLG humour.

## Installation

The game does not need to be installed to run. For newer versions, the shebang should automatically tell the system what program it runs under (if you are using Linux or MacOS) otherwise, installation is still really simple.

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you must have Python installed (any version between 2.0 and 3.10 will work) that is all.

### On BSD

This program has not been tested on BSD yet.

### On Linux

This program has not been tested on Linux yet.

### On MacOS

This program has not been tested on MacOS yet.

### On Windows

This program was originally written and tested on Windows 10, so I know it works. To run the `*.pedo` file, go to the file, click `properties` select `open with` and choose the Python interpreter as the default program for running `*.pedo` files. Then simply run the file. It should display in a Python terminal. The same should work on any modern version of Windows, it will likely run on:
